                    <h4 class="sub_title_desc">
                        Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                        The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                        living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love 
                        with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and deer graze 
                        on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. 
                        The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the 
                        sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the 
                        longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, 
                        faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. 
                        There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to 
                        appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                    <h4 class="sub_title_desc">
                        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green
                        river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert 
                        scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys 
                        Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, 
                        evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich 
                        history that the canyon tells.

                        This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. 
                        You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to 
                        make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating 
                        whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically 
                        rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people
                        are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
